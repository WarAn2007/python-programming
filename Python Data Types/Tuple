# Tuple
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable
# 1. Access and Change of Items
Access is same as in list, by index. We can do both positive and negative searches.
# 2. Add and Remove Items
Since we cannot change tuple collecton, we need to convert it to list to add or remove items by methods of list
```py
mytuple = (5,6,4,3,2,1)
mytuple.remove() # Error
tuple(list(mytuple).remove(6))
tuple(list(mytuple).append(7))
```
1. We convert tuple to list list(mytuple), lets say in short it is "converted_tuple"
2. Then from our 'list' we remove 6 converted_tuple.remove(6) OR add 7 converted_tuple.append(7)
3. Then we convert it again to tuple tuple(...)
# 3. Unpacking
Unpacking here is like refering items inside of tuple to some groups
```py
mytuple = ('apple','watermelon','banana')
(green, red, yellow) = mytuple
print(green,' ',red,' ',  yellow) #Output: apple watermelon banana

mytuple = ('cucumber','banana','apple','watermelon','tomato')
(green, yellow, *red) = mytuple # Asteriks (*) means choose all other that left to category 'red'
print(red,' ', green, ' ', yellow)
#Output:  ['apple', 'watermelon', 'tomato'] cucumber banana

mytuple = ('cucumber','banana','apple','watermelon','tomato')
(green, *yellow, red) = mytuple # With asteriks in this position compiler refers all items between first and last elements
print(red,' ', green, ' ', yellow)
#Output:   tomato cucumber ['banana','apple', 'watermelon']
```
# 4. Join Tuples
```py
tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)
```
## OR
```py
tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
tuple1 = tuple1 * 2
print(tuple1) #Output: ["a", "b" , "c","a", "b" , "c"]
```
# 5. Methods
```txt
Mostly same with list methods excluding add and remove methods
```
